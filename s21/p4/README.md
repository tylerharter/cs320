# Project 4: Building a Data Website

## Corrections / Clarifications

* [March 10th]: Fixed SVG counting error.
* [March 8th]: Use `threaded=False` in `app.run`.
* [March 8th]: FAQ post [here](https://piazza.com/class/kjomvrz8kyl64u?cid=572).
* [March 7th]: README, tester added.

## Handin

When you're done, you'll hand in a .zip file containing `main.py`,
`main.csv`, and any `.html` files necessary (basically whatever we need 
to run your website).

You can create a zip file from the terminal.  Let's say you're already in 
a directory named `p4`.  You can run this to create a compressed p4.zip
file alongside your directory:

```
zip ../p4.zip main.py main.csv *.html
```

If you haven't installed `zip` before, you might see this:

```
Command 'zip' not found, but can be installed with:

apt install zip
Please ask your administrator.
```

Follow the suggestion by running the `apt install zip` command
suggested.  Of course, only the root user can install software with
`apt`, so you'll need to tweak the suggested command by adding `sudo`
to the beginning.

Once you have the .zip ready, you can download it to your laptop (via
Jupyter) then upload it to the site.

**Important:** make sure your program is named `main.py` (we've been more 
flexible about this in the past, but naming it something else causes 
problems for us now that it's in a zip).

## Overview

In this project, you'll build a website for sharing a dataset -- you
get to pick the dataset!  There's a lot of relevant topics right now, 
like COVID-19, the election, fires, etc., so try to pick something relevant 
to what's been going on lately that you're passionate about! (More on 
possible sources for data later)

You'll use the flask framework for the site, which will have the
following features: (1) multiple plots on the home page, (2) a page
for browsing through the table behind the plots, (3) a link to a
donation page that is optimized via A/B testing, and (4) a subscribe
button that only accepts valid email addresses.

Creating a web application is a very new kind of programming,
different from writing code in a notebook or creating a `.py` module.
So get started soon!  Our office hours are always boring the first
week a project is released and crazy the week it is due, so starting
early is a good way to get a larger slice of TA/instructor time.

Your `.py` file may be short, perhaps <100 lines, but it will probably
take a fair bit of time to get those lines right.


## Setup

First, install some things:

```
pip3 install Flask lxml html5lib beautifulsoup4
```

Download `tester.py` -- as always, run it often!  You'll create the rest of the files from scratch.  

**Note:** Running `tester.py` locally can be very helpful and time-saving for you if you haven't already been doing so. For the most part, this will let you know how your code will perform against our tests. While we still may take points off, this is a good way to ensure nothing is very off from what we're expecting.

## Data

You get to choose the dataset for this project.  Find a CSV you like
somewhere, then download it as a file named `main.csv`.

The file should have between 10 and 1000 rows and between 3 and 15
columns.  Feel free to drop rows/columns from your original data
source if necessary.

**Mandatory**: Leave a comment in your `main.py` about the source of your 
data and another comment about an interesting graph you could make using 
this data. (Just be creative and show us that you've thought about your 
data a bit)

Two good places to check while looking for a dataset are [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and 
Google's [Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/). 

## Pages

Your web application should have three pages:
* index.html
* browse.html
* donate.html

We have some requirements about what is on these, but you have quite a
bit of creative freedom for this project.

To get started, consider creating a minimal `index.html` file:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>Enjoy the data.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then create a simple flask app in `main.py` with a route for the
homepage that loads `index.html`:

```python
import pandas as pd
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
# df = pd.read_csv("main.csv")

@app.route('/')
def home():
    with open("index.html") as f:
        html = f.read()

    return html

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", debug=True, threaded=False) # don't change this line!

# NOTE: app.run never returns (it runs for ever, unless you kill the process)
# Thus, don't define any functions after the app.run call, because it will
# never get that far.
```

Try launching your application by running `python3 main.py`:
```
trh@instance-1:~/p4$ python3 main.py
 * Serving Flask app "main" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

This program runs indefinitely, until you kill it with `CTRL+C` (meaning press `CTRL` and `C` at the same time).
Unfortunately, you may need to restart each time for new changes to
show up (unless you find a way to configure flask otherwise).

Open your web browser and go to `http://your-ip:5000` to see your page
("your-ip" is the IP you use to SSH to your VM).

Requirements:

* Going to `http://your-ip:port/browse.html` should return the content for `browse.html`, and similarly for the other pages.
* The index.html page should have hyperlinks to all the other pages. Slide 4 of [this powerpoint](https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs320/s21/lec/16-selenium/slides.pdf) has some nice examples. (Be sure to not include your IP here! A relative path is fine.)
* You should put whatever content you think makes sense on the pages.  Just make sure that they all start with an `<h1>` heading, giving the page a title.

## Browse

The `browse.html` page should show an HTML table with all the data
from `main.csv`.  Don't truncate the table (meaning we want to see all
the rows).  Don't have any other tables on this page, so as not to
confuse our tester.

The page might look something like this:

<img src="img/browse.png" width=500>

**Hint 1:** you don't necessarily need to have an actual `browse.html`
file just because there's a `browse.html` page.  For example, here's a
`hi.html` page without a corresponding `hi.html` file:

```python
@app.route('/hi.html')
def hi_handler():
    return "howdy!"
```

For browse, instead of returning a hardcoded string, you'll need to
generate a string containing HTML code for the table, then return that
string. For example, `"<html>{}<html>".format("hello")` would insert `"hello"`
into the middle of a string containing HTML code. 

**Hint 2:** look into `_repr_html_` for DataFrames (or possibly `to_html()`).


## Emails

There should be a button on your site that allows people to share
their email with you to get updates about changes to the data:

<img src="img/emails.png" width=90>

When the button is clicked, some JavaScript code will run that does the following:
1. pops up a box asking the user for their email
2. sends the email to your flask application
3. depending on how your flask application responds, the JavaScript will either tell the user "thanks" or show an error message of your choosing

We'll give you the HTML+JavaScript parts, since we haven't taught that in class.

Add the following `<head>` code to your `index.html`, before the `<body>` code:

```html
  <head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.js"></script>
    <script>
      function subscribe() {
        var email = prompt("What is your email?", "????");

        $.post({
          type: "POST",
          url: "email",
          data: email,
          contentType: "application/text; charset=utf-8",
          dataType: "json"
        }).done(function(data) {
          alert(data);
        }).fail(function(data) {
          alert("POST failed");
        });
      }
    </script>
  </head>
```

Then, in the main body of the HTML, add this code for the button somewhere:

```html
<button onclick="subscribe()">Subscribe</button>
```

Whenever the user clicks that button and submits an email, it will
POST the data to the `/email` route in your app, so add that to your
`main.py`:

```python
@app.route('/email', methods=["POST"])
def email():
    email = str(request.data, "utf-8")
    if re.match(r"????", email): # 1
        with open("emails.txt", "a") as f: # open file in append mode
            f.????(email + ????) # 2
        return jsonify("thanks, you're subscriber number {}!".format(n))
    return jsonify(????) # 3
```

Fill in the `????` parts in the above code so that it:
1. use a regex that determines if the email is valid
2. writes each valid email address on its own line in `emails.txt`
3. sternly warns the user if they entered an invalid email address to stop being so careless (you choose the wording)

Also find a way to fill the variable `n` with the number of users that have subscribed so far, 
including the user that just got accepted. 

Note: Although it will be talked about more later, you can find information about 
`jsonify` [here](https://www.kite.com/python/docs/flask.jsonify) if you're curious right now. 

## Donations

On your donations page, write some text, making your best plea for funding.

Then, let's find out the best design for the homepage, so that people
are most likely to click the link to the donations page.

We'll do an A/B test.  Create two version of the homepage, A and B.
They should differ in some way, perhaps trivial (e.g., maybe the link
to donations is blue in version A and red in version B).

The first 10 times your homepage is visited, alternate between version
A and B each time.  After that, pick the best version (the one where
people click to donate most often), and keep showing it for all future
visits to the page.

**Hint 1:** consider having a global counter in `main.py` to keep track of
how many times the home page has been visited.  Consider whether this
number is 10 or less and whether it is even/odd when deciding between
showing version A or B.

**Hint 2:** when somebody visits `donate.html`, we need to know if
  they took a link from version A or B of the homepage.  The easiest
  way is with query strings.  On version A of the homepage, instead of
  having a regular link to "donate.html", link to
  "donate.html?from=A", and in the link on version B to
  donate.html, use "donate.html?from=B".  Then the handler for
  the "donate.html" route can keep count of how much people are
  using the links on both versions of the home page. (Hint 1 of the API 
  section is a good refresher for pulling A/B out of the query string.) 
  
**Hint 3:** You shouldn't need to have two different versions of your homepage 
to make this work. Once you read your index.html file into your program, you 
can edit it. At that point it should be a string, so you could add something 
to it or replace something in it.

## Dashboard

Implement a dashboard on your homepage showing at least 3 SVG images. 
The SVG images must correspond to at least 2 different flask routes, i.e., 
one route must be used at least twice with different query strings (resulting in different plots), 
similar to the [lecture reading](https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs320/s21/lec/21-dashboards/reading.html).

### Requirements

* All plots are based on the data chosen for `browse.html`, but you are free to choose what is plotted. 
Plots should have labels for both axes and optionally a title.

* Similarly, there is no restriction on the choice of query string parameters, 
except that the resulting plots should be distinct.

E.g., We could have a dashboard with the following lines added to the
`index.html` file (you're encouraged to use more descriptive names for
your .svg routes).

```html
<img src="dashboard_1.svg"><br><br>
<img src="dashboard_1.svg?cmap=damage"><br><br>
<img src="dashboard_2.svg"><br><br>
```

The dashboard SVGs may look something like this:

#### dashboard_1.svg
![Dashboard_1](img/dashboard_1.svg)

#### dashboard_1.svg?cmap=damage

Here, the query string uses `cmap`, which specifies an additional third column to use for a colormap.

![Dashboard_1 cmap damage](img/dashboard_1_cmap_damage.svg)

#### dashboard_2.svg

![Dashboard_2](img/dashboard_2.svg)

When using query strings, ensure appropriate default values are supplied.

### Important

* Ensure you are using the "Agg" backend for matplotlib, by explicitly setting
    
    ```python
    matplotlib.use('Agg')
    ```

    right after importing matplotlib.

* Ensure that `app.run` is launched with `threaded=False`.
    
* Further, use `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` to create the plots and close the plots after `savefig` with `plt.close(fig)` (otherwise you may run out of memory).

## Concluding Thoughts

Get started early, test often, and, above all, have fun with this one!
