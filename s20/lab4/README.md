# Lab 4: Linked List and P2 Prep

Start a new notebook on your virtual machine, then complete the two parts of the lab:

1. learn about [linked lists](part1.md) -- this is good practice to prepare for the next topics in the course, trees and grahps
2. learn about [zipped data](part2.md) -- for P2 (released after this lab), we'll ask you to analyzed data directly in a zip file, without unzipping first; you'll practice that here

Have fun, and let us know if you have any questions!
