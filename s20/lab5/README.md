# UNDER CONSTRUCTION, DO NOT START YET

# Lab 5: BSTs, Time Formatting, and Queues

Start a new notebook on your virtual machine, then complete the three parts of the lab:

1. practice with [binary search trees](part1.md) -- good prep for P2
2. convert [dates to strings](part2.md) -- will also need this for P2
3. learn about [queues](part3.md) -- fast data structure for modifying beginning of list

Have fun, and let us know if you have any questions!
